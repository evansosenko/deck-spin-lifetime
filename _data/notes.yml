    - Spin injection experimental geometry
    - Ferromagnetic contacts (F) on semiconductor (N) (graphene)
    - Current flows on the left only from the injector (I) at \( x = 0 \) into (N)
    - Spin current diffuses to the detector (D) at \( x = L \)
    - Measured voltage is proportional to the spin chemical potential at (D)
    - Modeled by diffusion equation.
    - Include effects on contacts with \( J_{↑↓}^C \)
    - Solve by assuming appropriate continuity conditions on current and spin current at (I) and (D)
    - Applied transverse magnetic field causes spins to precess as they diffuse

- id: nonlocal_resistance
  text:
    - Nonlocal resistance is the voltage normalized by the injected current
    - Boundary conditions give linear system, solve to obtain \( μ_s^N \)
    - Sign will change when alignment of the field (as compared to the ferromagnet) changes from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP) to the field
    - \( P \) is a polarization, \( P ≤ 1 \)
    - \( R_N \) is effectively the resistance of (N) over the spin diffusion length \( λ \)
    - \( r \) is a new length scale introduced by the contact resistance and effectively proportional to it
