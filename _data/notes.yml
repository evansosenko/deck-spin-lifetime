    - Spin injection experimental geometry
    - Ferromagnetic contacts (F) on semiconductor (N) (graphene)
    - Current flows on the left only from the injector (I) at \( x = 0 \) into (N)
    - Spin current diffuses to the detector (D) at \( x = L \)
    - Measured voltage is proportional to the spin chemical potential at (D)
    - Modeled by diffusion equation.
    - Include effects on contacts with \( J_{↑↓}^C \)
    - Solve by assuming appropriate continuity conditions on current and spin current at (I) and (D)
    - Applied transverse magnetic field causes spins to precess as they diffuse
