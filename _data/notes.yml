    - Spin injection experimental geometry.
    - Ferromagnetic contacts (F) on semiconductor (N) (graphene).
    - Current flows on the left only from the injector (I) at \( x = 0 \) into (N).
    - Spin current diffuses to the detector (D) at \( x = L \).
    - Measured voltage is proportional to the spin chemical potential at (D).
    - Modeled by diffusion equation.
    - Include effects on contacts with \( J_{↑↓}^C \).
    - Solve by assuming appropriate continuity conditions on current and spin current at (I) and (D).
    - Applied transverse magnetic field causes spins to precess as they diffuse.

- id: nonlocal_resistance
  text:
    - Nonlocal resistance is the voltage normalized by the injected current.
    - Boundary conditions give linear system, solve to obtain \( μ_s^N \).
    - Sign will change when alignment of the field (as compared to the ferromagnet) changes from parallel (P) to antiparallel (AP).
    - \( P \) is a polarization factor, \( P ≤ 1 \).
      Depends on resistances and conductivities.
    - \( R_N \) is effectively the resistance of (N) over the spin diffusion length \( λ \).
    - \( r \) is a new length scale introduced by the contact resistance and effectively proportional to it.
    - Expression reduces to the typical case where contacts are ignored in the limit \( r → ∞ \).

- id: fits
  text:
    - Fit done with Python using least squares.
    - Tunneling contacts with finite \( r \) give same \( τ \).
    - This is to be expected since tunneling contacts have high effective resistance.
    - Transparent contacts with finite \( r \) only changed \( τ \) by a factor of 2.
    - All fits have Chi-squared much less than unity.

- id: limits
  text:
    - There are a few key limits we considered.
    - Tunneling contacts when \(r ≫ λ \), essentially \( R_C → ∞ \), and all the terms with \( λ / r \) become small.
      Then, \( f \) reduces to the previously considered case that ignores the contact resistance.
